## What Is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the **content** of your document. Using ```&lt;tags>``` we can create **elements** that represent items on our page.  Items like paragraphs.
```html
&lt;p>Paragraph Text&lt;/p>
```
Lists

```html
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>List Item&lt;/li> 
	&lt;li>List Item&lt;/li> 
	&lt;li>List Item&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul> 
```

and images

```html
&lt;img src="http://www.fillmurray.com/300/300" alt="Placeholder Image" />
```

				</section>
				<section>

<h2> By placing these items together on a page we get something that looks like this: </h2>

<p>Paragraph Text</p>
<ul>
<li>List Item</li> 
<li>List Item</li> 
<li>List Item</li>
</ul> 
<p><img src="http://www.fillmurray.com/300/300" alt="Placeholder Image" /></p>

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
## What Is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the **style** of your document. They help control the look and feel of the document. You create **selectors** that target **HTML Elements** and then use **CSS Rules** to change the look and feel of your document.

Selectors like:

	p { /* CSS Rules Here */ } 

Which targets all paragraphs, or:

	.rotator-slide { /* CSS Rules Here */ } 

Which targets *any* element with class="rotator-slide", or:

	#rotator { /* CSS Rules Here */ } 

Which targets *any* element with id="rotator".
					
				</section>
				<section>
<p>
	
<strong>CSS Rules</strong> go inside the {curly braces} that follow the **CSS Selector** and they look like this:
</p>
<pre><code> p {
	font-size: 2em;
	color: red;
} </code></pre>
<p> Which will apply the font size of <strong>2em</strong> and color of <strong>red</strong> to all paragraphs. </p>

<p style="font-size: 2em; color: red;">This is a paragraph with the styles above applied to it.</p>

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
## What Is JS?

JS (JavaScript) controls the **behavior** of your document. It allows you to do things such as animate items, hide or show items, react to user input and even process data and perform other general programming tasks.

JS can look like this:

	var myVariable = "Hello World";

That line will create a variable called **myVariable** and assign it a value of **Hello World** (without the quotes).

The structure and syntax of the language of JavaScript is much more complex than either HTML or CSS.  

This is because neither HTML nor CSS are full fledged programming languages.  Neither of them have **variables**, **functions**, **objects** or **control structures** such as **if** statements or **loops**.  JavaScript has *all* of these.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>

# So what *are* **variables**, **functions**, **objects** and **control structures** such as **if** statements or **loops**?

They are the basic building blocks of programming!

Because this session is only an hour and a half, and because we have a *specific* goal in mind we will not be going to great detail about all of these and exactly what they are and what they do.  We will however be talking about them briefly.  Enough so that we can understand what our image rotator is doing on a basic level.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
# Variables

## What *is* a variable?

A variable is a storage location and an associated symbolic name (an identifier) which contains some known or unknown quantity or information, a value.

### In *English* professor.

At its most basic we make a variable when we give a **name** to a **value**.  So when we say:

	var myVariable = "Hello World";

We are taking the value ```Hello World``` and giving it the name ```myVariable```.  
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Variable *values* can be one of several different **types**.  In this case, a value with text in it is called a **string** value.

	var myVariable = "Hello World";

Variables can also contain numbers,
 
	var meaningOfLife = 42; // Whole numbers are called 'integers'

Variables that contain true / false values are called **booleans**

	var isJavaScriptCool = true;
	var isJavaScriptLame = false;

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Variable can even hold lists of values (the list values themselves being **types** like strings or booleans) in what is called an **array**

	var myFavoriteThings = [
		"Raindrops On Roses",
		"Whiskers On Kittens",
	];

We will not go into an exhaustive list here but it is important that you understand that variables hold values and the values themselves have types.


				</section>
				<section>

<h2> Using a variable </h2>

<p>The first time we create a variable we do so by using the JavaScript keyword <strong>var</strong></p>

<pre><code>var myVariable = "Hello World";</code></pre>

<p>That line of code will create a new variable called <strong>myVariable</strong> and assign it the <strong>string</strong> value of <strong>Hello World</strong></p>

<pre><code class="javascript">// Let's break this down.
	var myVariable = "Hello World";
/*	 |       |     |       └ The String Value "Hello World".
	 |       |     └ The 'assignment' opperator - A single equals sign.
	 |       └ The Variable Name "myVariable".
	 └ The 'var' keyword.
*/
</code></pre>
<p>The var keyword is only needed when you <strong>first create the variable</strong>.  You do not need to use the <strong>var</strong> keyword again later when referencing or manipulating the variable.</p>
				</section>
				<section>

<h2> Using a variable </h2>

<p>After we have assigned the variable a value we can now use that variable the same way we would use the value.  Let's take the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var myVariable = "Hello World";
alert(myVariable);
</code></pre>

<p> That code would make an alert box like the one you will see if you click the link below</p> 
<p><a href="#example_1">Click here to view the alert box</a></button> </p>
<script>
	$(function(){
		$("#example-1").click(function(event) {
		});
	});
</script>

<p>This uses the built in JavaScript <strong> function </strong> called 'alert', which creates a popup message that the user <em>must</em> dismiss or acknowledge before continuing any interaction with the page.</p>


				</section>
				<section data-markdown>

# JavaScript Functions

if a variable is a **name** for a **value**, then a function is a **name** for a set of commands or instructions.  For example:
```javascript
function sayHello(){
	/*
	There can be many commands here in between the two {curly braces}
	Let's make the first command an alert to the user.
	*/ 
	alert("Hello World");
}
```
This creates a new **function** called "sayHello" which, when invoked, will execute the **alert** function that comes built into javascipt.

The **alert** function is a **Built In Function** and the **sayHello** function is a **User Defined Function**.  The only difference between them is that you don't have to write a built in function, it comes for free as a part of JavaScript.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>

# JavaScript Functions

Functions can be used to make your life a LOT easier once you get used to how to write them.  A function should be used when you have something you need to do time and again in your project.

## Function Parameters

Using the code from our previous slide:

```javascript
function sayHello(){
	alert("Hello World");
}
```
We notice that the ```sayHello()``` function has empty parenthesis () while the ```alert()``` function has the **string** value "Hello World" in the parenthesis ().


This introduces an important concept with functions called **parameters**.

 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
# JavaScript Functions
## Function Parameters

**Parameters** are data that you pass to a function that becomes available for use IN that function as a variable.  Let's say that rather than simply saying "Hello World", you might want to say something else, or many other things.  Let's see what that might look like:

```javascript
function sayAnything(message){
	alert(message);
}
```

Now if we wanted to use that code we could do this:

```javascript
sayAnything("Check out my cool new boombox!");
```
Which would cause the browser to pop up that message. [Or any other message we wanted to say](#example_2).

# JavaScript Functions

A function is one of the most powerful tools in JavaScript and one of the most powerful functions you will ever use is this one:

```javascript
jQuery();
```
## So *what is* **jQuery** anyways?

jQuery is a JavaScript **library**. Meaning that it is a set of pre written coded instructions, tools, functions and helpers that you can download and then use in your projects. 

Think of it this way.  If JavaScript is a language like english, then jQuery is like a dictionary.  It makes working with the language easier.

# jQuery
## Downloading and using jQuery.

We can download the latest version of jQuery from their website at [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com).

![jQuery download page](./content/images/example_jquery_1.jpg)

Click the big "Download jQuery" button.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# jQuery
## Downloading and using jQuery.

This will take you to [http://jquery.com/download/](http://jquery.com/download/) where you will see links to several different versions of jQuery.  There is a lot of information on this page but we want to focus on the dowloads for [jQuery 1.x](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-1-x) and [jQuery 2.x](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-2-x).

The newest version of jQuery (Version 2.1.1) is arguably the best vesion yet.  It is lean and fast and very powerful.  In order to achieve that power the jQuery team had to make a difficult choice. They had to drop support for Internet Explorer 6, 7 &amp; 8.  

Version 2 doesn't do anything that version 1 doesn't do, it just does it all **much faster**. Unless you are *certain* no IE 6/7/8 users are visiting your site, you should use the Version 1 of jQuery.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# jQuery
## Downloading and using jQuery.

To download jQuery find the link that says [Download the compressed, production jQuery 1.11.1](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js)

![jQuery download page](./content/images/example_jquery_2.jpg)

Right click that link and choose **Save Link As...** and choose the location on your computer where you are storing your Hackapalooza project.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# jQuery
## Downloading and using jQuery.

After saving it to your computer, open up the folder where you are storing your Hackapalooza project. (Windows users will use Windows Explorer and Mac Users will use Finder)  Create a new folder in the project and call it 'js', This is where we will store all our javascript files. 

It is always a good idea to keep your project organized so keeping your files in folders like 'js', 'css', and 'img' is a good practice to follow.

Drag the file **jquery-1.11.1.min.js** into that new **js** folder.

You have now downloaded jQuery.  The next step is to put it to use.


				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# Take A Breather.

Take a moment to work with your mentors to ensure that you have the **jquery-1.11.1.min.js** file saved to your computer in the '**js**' folder in your **hackapalooza project folder**.

We will continue once everyone has had a chance to make sure that they are this far and to have asked their mentors any questions they may have.

If you are having trouble [Right click this link to the jQuery library file and press **Save Link As...** and choose the location on your computer where you are storing your Hackapalooza project](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js).  Save the file in the subdirectory **js** in that location.

# Let's Review

We have covered a lot so far, let's make sure we have a handle on all of this up to now.

* **HTML** is what makes the content of a webpage.
* **CSS** is what makes the look and feel of a webpage.
* **JS** is what makes the behavior of a webpage.
* **jQuery** is a library, written in JS, designed to make adding behavior to webpages easier than writing regular javascript.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# Let's Review


* JS has **variables**, which are named values that you can use to store things like numbers, strings of text and other JavaScript data types.
* JS also has **functions**, which are named collections of commands that you can use to execute similar commands over and over again without having to write out all the commands in the function each time you use it.
* The power of the jQuery library comes from the **jQuery()** function.

Ok enough review let's start using jQuery!
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# Using jQuery
## Step 1, include the jQuery file on your HTML page using a new tag called:
```HTML
&lt;script>
```

Using Sublime Text, or whatever text editor you are comfortable with & have been using so far for Hackapalooza, open up the source code for your page.  It is likely called **index.html**
				</section>
				<section> 
<h1> Using jQuery </h1>
<h2> Step 1, include the jQuery file on your HTML page using a new tag called: </h2>
<p> Locate the section of your html file called the **head** of the document.  it should look like this: </p>

<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;head>
	&lt;title>My Hackapalooza Page&lt;/title>
	&lt;!-- Links to stylesheets -->
	&lt;!-- Maybe some meta tags and other stuff -->
&lt;/head>
</code></pre>
<p> Inside the head tag put in the following new tag </p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>

<h2>What did we just do?</h2>

<p>Let's have a look.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Let's break this down.
&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
/*  |    |                 |              └ The closing 'script' tag.
    |    |                 └ The location of the JS file.
    |    └ The 'src' attribute of the 'script' tag expects a file location.
    └ The 'script' tag.  
      In HTML this tells the document that it's about to get JS commands.
*/
</code></pre>

<p>What we did was to add a new JS file to our document.  Now the JavaScript commands written in that document will be run when the webpage loads.</p>

<p>Great! Now let's go reload our page and see what jquery does when you include it in an HTML file.</p>

<p>To see your project, find the <strong> index.html </strong> file in your hackapalooza project folder and double click it to open it in Chrome.</p>

				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# Notice any difference in your project?
## No?

That's because the jQuery library on its own doesn't DO anything, it simply gives you the tools to do something. What we do is up to us.

Now that jQuery is on the page we can use the **jQuery();** function which is the real magic of jQuery.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown> 
# Using jQuery and the jQuery(); function

The basic idea of jQuery is that you target some item on the page and then add or change the behavior of that item.

For instance you could take a dropdown button in a menu and set it so that when it is hovered over, a new menu slides down from the top.  That might look like this:

```javascript
jQuery(".nav button.view-menu").hover(function(){
	jQuery(".nav .more-menu").slideDown();
}, function(){
	jQuery(".nav .more-menu").slideUp();
});
```

DEMO HERE
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# Using jQuery and the jQuery(); function

You could also make it so that when clicking on a button to dismiss a popup, you remove an element from the document.
 
```javascript
jQuery(".dialog .dismiss").click(function(){
	jQuery(this).parent().remove();
});
```
DEMO HERE

These are just simple examples.  With jQuery and a little imagination the possibilities are endless.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# How to select an item with jQuery(); 
## (So you can alter its behavior)

the ```jQuery();``` function takes a single parameter:  A string containing a CSS style selector indicating what item, or items, on the page to select.

Some examples:

```javascript
jQuery("ul li.even");
/*
	The line above selects all list items, with a class of "even" 
	in an any unordered list.
*/ 
jQuery("#rotator .slide:first");
/*
	The line above selects the first item with a class of "slide" 
	inside the item with an id of "rotator".
*/ 
``` 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# How to select an item with jQuery(); 
## (So you can alter its behavior)

The HTML items or your page that match your selector are added into something called the **wrapped set**.  This is a special grouping of items that jQuery uses to know what items to alter or add behavior to.

When you run a jQuery **method** the items in the **wrapped set** are the ones that will be altered or effected.
				</section>
				<section> 
<h1> jQuery Methods </h1>
<p> the jQuery library comes with many many MANY different methods.  We won't discuss all of them here but if you want to see them all, and how to use them, you can go to <a href="http://api.jquery.com" target-"_blank">api.jquery.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will discuss a few methods here and a few more once we start making our rotator.</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <strong>.hide();</strong> method will hide all elements in the wrapped set.</li>
	<li>the <strong>.show();</strong> method will show all elements in the wrapped set.</li>
	<li>the <strong>.css();</strong> method allows you to alter the look of the elements in the wrapped set by passing two parameters.  The CSS property you want to edit and the new value of that property</li>
</ul>

				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 

# jQuery Methods

For example:

```javascript
jQuery(".alert").css("color", "red");</code></pre>
```
Will take elements with a class of alert and make the text in them red.

This by no means an exhaustive list, we will take notice when we intruduce new methods as we go on.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# An Amazing Shortcut
## The Dollar Sign
```javascript
var $ = jQuery;
```
Anytime you want to write ```jQuery``` you can just write ```$``` instead.  It saves a lot of time.  Writing:
```javascript
$('.myClass');
```
is the same as writing:
```javascript
jQuery('.myClass');
```
and that's just what we'll be doing going forward.



				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# One last thing before we get into it the rotator.

## Timing.

Your webpage, like all webpages, gets downloaded by the browser.  The browser downloads the page from top to bottom and when it see any javascript, it runs it.  Right then and there.  So if you add this:
```javascript 
$("p.highlight").css("background-color", "yellow");
```
and then later in the page you put

```html
&lt;p class="highlight">This is an important highlighted paragraph&lt;/p>
```
The javascript code will run BEFORE the browser will even see the paragraph tag.  That means that jQuery won't match the element and won't make it's background color yellow!

				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# Enter Document Ready

Document ready is an **event**.  It's a *point in time* when the browser has downloaded enough of your page that it has seen all your tags and it can find them based off of the CSS selectors that you tell jQuery.

Running that same code on the **document ready** event looks like this:
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
	$("p.highlight").css("background-color", "yellow");
});
```
Document Ready is a little bit of a complex idea and again because we only have a small amount of time we won't explain how it works in great detail here.  Just trust me, you need it if you want your code to work. 
				</section>
				<section>
<p> Go to your project in your text editor and find where we added the following line: </p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and <strong> after that </strong> add this:</p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
	// Add all jQuery code here.
});
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That area is where we will add ALL of our jQuery code going forward.  When I say "Add this code to your document ready function" that is where I mean.</p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
	// Right Here. your code goes right here.
});
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>

				<section data-markdown>
# Finally...
## We get to the image rotator
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
# Finally...
## We get to the image rotator

So, What IS an image rotator?

At it's most basic, a rotator is a list of images that uses javascript to show one image on its own, then another, then another...  SO if we used HTML like this:

```html
&lt;div id="rotator">
	&lt;ul class="slides">
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="content/rotator/image1.jpg" alt="First Slide">&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="content/rotator/image2.jpg" alt="Second Slide">&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="content/rotator/image3.jpg" alt="Third Slide">&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;/div>
```

The javascript would show the first and hide the rest. Then, after a couple of seconds,  show the second and hide the rest.  Then keep going until all of the slides have been shown.  Then start again at the beginning. 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown> 
# How Would We Build That?

In order to build something like this we need to know how to hide objects, how to show them and how to wait a set amount of time before moving to the next image.  Using the HTML from before we could do something like this:

```javascript
setInterval(function(){
	if($('#rotator .rotator-items li:visible').next().length == 0){
		$('#rotator .rotator-items li:visible').hide();
		$('#rotator .rotator-items li:first').show();
	} else {
		$('#rotator .rotator-items li:visible').hide().next().show();
	}
	
}, 2000);
```
You can see an example of this in the next slide

# Ok Cool, what ELSE can it do?

Well that is really only limited by our imagination, and We're not the first people to ask that question.  What can a rotator do?  It would seem that many people have actually aready answered the question and have made their answers free for use in your projects.

For this reason we are not going to write our own rotator jQuery.  We are going to use someone else's hard work and reap the rewards.  Everything up to this point has been about getting you to understand the forces at play in this exercise.  to make it so that you know, on a basic level what is going on.

# Enter Flexslider

Flexslider is a very capable, well maintained and responsive jQuery rotator.  Best of all it's free and easy to use.

## Downloading Flexslider

Head on over to [http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/)

Click the big green download button and download the zip file.  Expand that zip file and then take the entire folder that comes out of it and drop it into the 'js' folder in your project.  Rename that folder to 'flexslider' (all lowercase) and then we're good.  It should look like this:

![Flexslider in the project directory](./content/images/example_flexslider_1.jpg)

<p>
	
Go to your <strong>
	
index.html
</strong>
 file on your hackapalooza project in <strong>
 sublime text</strong> and find this section:
</p>


<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
	// Add all jQuery code here.
});
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
	and we are going to put some new code in the middle of this so that it looks like this instead:
</p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script src="js/flexslider/jquery.flexslider-min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
	// Add all jQuery code here.
});
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section> 
<p>notice the addition of the line:</p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/flexslider/jquery.flexslider-min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
<p> in between: </p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/flexslider/jquery.flexslider-min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;</code></pre>

<p> and: </p>

<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
	// Add all jQuery code here.
});
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
	to make:
</p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script src="js/flexslider/jquery.flexslider-min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

# Ok Breathe...

You now have averything in place to make your slider. All we have to do after this is:

1. Add the **HTML** needed for the rotator
2. Trigger flexslider to add new **behavior** to that HTML.

### From this point forward...

we will be writing code on our projects that will be individualized to our own needs.

I will give example **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **jQuery** code but you will need to adapt that code to do *what you want to do for your project*.
